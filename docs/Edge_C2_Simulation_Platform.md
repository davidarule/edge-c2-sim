Simulation platforms for real-time C2 demonstration
The TAK ecosystem combined with CesiumJS and Python-based signal simulators offers the fastest, most complete open-source path to a multi-domain C2 demonstration — but commercial platforms like VR-Forces and Command: Professional Edition deliver significantly higher fidelity with less custom development. This survey evaluates 60+ platforms across 10 categories, identifying a clear tier structure: three commercial platforms and one open-source stack can cover air, land, and sea domains simultaneously with real-time map visualization, while dozens of specialized tools fill gaps in signal simulation, movement generation, and visualization. The Malaysian defense context — Strait of Malacca operations, DSA 2026 (April 20–23, MITEC KL), and LIMA — demands professional aesthetics with MIL-STD-2525D symbology, and several platforms are already proven in this exact market.

Tier 1: Multi-domain platforms that work nearly out of the box
These platforms simulate air, land, and sea entities simultaneously with professional-grade visuals, programmable backends, and proven defense adoption. Any of them could anchor a C2 demo with minimal custom development.
VR-Forces (VT MAK) — strongest commercial candidate
VR-Forces is a Computer Generated Forces platform covering air, land, sea, and space at both entity and aggregate levels. It renders entities on a dual 2D/3D tactical display with MIL-STD-2525B symbology, satellite imagery, and whole-earth terrain. The simulation engine is fully separable from the GUI, supporting DIS and HLA interoperability. A 2025 "DB Connect" feature pipes entity data directly into MySQL and SQLite databases — making REST API integration straightforward.
VR-Forces ships with hundreds of pre-built entity types, autonomous behaviors (patrol, detect, attack, communicate, flee), and "patterns of life" generation for all domains. It is explicitly designed to stimulate C4I systems. Critically, MAK Technologies recently conducted a tailored workshop in Kuala Lumpur with local integrator Kemalak Group SDN BHD, establishing a direct Malaysian market presence.

License: Commercial (pricing on request, part of MAK ONE suite)
Domains: Air + Land + Sea + Space
API: DIS, HLA, DB Connect (MySQL/SQLite), C++ plugin SDK
What needs modification: Custom Malaysian agency entity types, agency-specific iconography
Demo fit: ★★★★★
Command: Professional Edition — best simulation API
Command PE is the professional superset of the award-winning Command: Modern Operations wargame, used by 25+ nations and 150+ organizations including the US Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, UK MOD, Boeing, BAE Systems, and Lockheed Martin. Its physics-based models simulate every engagement type from air-to-air combat to submarine warfare to electronic warfare, on a global map with half a terabyte of satellite imagery.
Where Command PE truly excels is its TCP/IP Lua socket API — external applications can read and manipulate the running simulation remotely in real time. Entity positions, AI decisions, weapon engagements, and fuel states stream out at configurable rates based on entity speed. It supports DIS interoperability (Premium Edition), headless command-line execution, Monte Carlo batch analysis, and XML import/export. The commercial version (CMO) is available on Steam for ~$80, making proof-of-concept extremely accessible before investing in PE licensing.

Domains: Air + Naval + Land (strongest in air/naval)
API: Lua TCP/IP socket, XML export/import, DIS (Premium), CLI mode
What needs modification: Custom web dashboard to consume Lua API output; non-military entity types
Demo fit: ★★★★★
FreeTAKServer + TAK ecosystem — best open-source stack
The TAK (Team Awareness Kit) ecosystem provides the most mature open-source path to a multi-domain C2 demonstration. FreeTAKServer (Python, Eclipse Public License) implements the TAK server protocol compatible with ATAK (Android), WinTAK (Windows), iTAK (iOS), and WebTAK (browser). Entities are represented using the Cursor on Target (CoT) XML protocol with MIL-STD-2525 type codes.
FreeTAKServer exposes a REST API for programmatic entity injection: POST /ManageCoT/postCoT pushes entity positions that immediately appear on all connected TAK clients. The critical integration libraries are PyTAK (Python TAK client framework, Apache 2.0), AISCOT (AIS-to-CoT gateway for maritime), and ADSBCOT (ADS-B-to-CoT for aviation). A Python script using PyTAK can generate simulated entities for police vehicles (CoT type a-f-G-U-C-I), maritime enforcement vessels (a-f-S-X-N), customs vehicles (a-f-G-E-V-C), military aircraft (a-f-A-M-F-Q), and ground troops (a-f-G-U-C) — all rendering with proper symbology on any TAK client.

License: EPL (FreeTAKServer), Apache 2.0 (PyTAK, AISCOT, ADSBCOT)
Domains: All — via CoT protocol type codes covering every MIL-STD-2525 battle dimension
API: REST API + CoT XML/Protobuf over TCP + WebSocket/SocketIO
What needs modification: Custom Malaysian agency icon packs, simulated entity movement scripts, Malaysian map tiles
Demo fit: ★★★★☆ (open source) to ★★★★★ (with official TAK Server from tak.gov)
SitaWare (Systematic) — the gold-standard C2 display
SitaWare is not a simulator — it is the world's leading operational C4ISR software, selected by NATO as its primary C2 system (FLC2/DEMETER project, €28.21M contract) and adopted by 50+ countries including France (January 2026). It provides exactly the kind of professional Joint Common Operating Picture (JCOP) that senior Malaysian defense officials would expect to see: land picture (SitaWare HQ), maritime picture (SitaWare Maritime), and air picture, with automatic track correlation and fusion, NATO-standard symbology, and support for Link 16, OTH-Gold, and AIS feeds.
SitaWare can be stimulated by simulation systems like MASA SWORD or VR-Forces, creating a realistic C2 demonstration where simulated entities appear on a production-grade C2 display. The SitaWare-SWORD integration path has been publicly demonstrated.
URL: systematic.com/int/industries/defence
License: Commercial (enterprise pricing)
Best use: As the display frontend fed by a simulation backend (VR-Forces, SWORD, or custom)
Demo fit: ★★★★★ as a C2 display

Tier 2: Specialized tools for each simulation domain
AIS simulators for maritime vessel generation
The Python library pyais (MIT, github.com/M0r13n/pyais) is the most mature AIS encoding/decoding tool, supporting all 27 message types with encode_dict() for programmatic NMEA sentence generation. For realistic ship routes, download historical AIS data from NOAA AccessAIS (free, US waters) or purchase global datasets from MarineTraffic/Spire, then modify MMSI identifiers and replay. The abuech2s/nmeasim project (github.com/abuech2s/nmeasim) simultaneously simulates AIS, ADS-B, radar, GPS, and weather via XML configuration with separate TCP/UDP ports per protocol — a uniquely multi-sensor tool. Sailsoft NemaStudio (commercial, sailsoft.nl) provides professional-grade NMEA/AIS simulation used by KNRM Sea Rescue, supporting Class A/B vessels, SAR aircraft, AtoN, and base stations.
For the Strait of Malacca context: the TSS spans 250 nautical miles from One Fathom Bank to Horsburgh Lighthouse with two-lane opposing traffic, 500+ vessel transits daily, and VLCCs limited to ≤12 knots. Simulated vessels should follow the defined TSS waypoints (starting ~01°12'N, 103°52'E) with realistic speeds: cargo 12–16 knots, tankers 12–15 knots, patrol vessels 20–30 knots, speedboats 30–50 knots.
ADS-B simulators for aircraft track generation
BlueSky (MIT, github.com/TUDelft-CNS-ATM/bluesky) from TU Delft is the premier open-source air traffic simulator with physics-based aircraft performance models (OpenAP data), FMS navigation (LNAV/VNAV), and conflict detection. It generates realistic climb/cruise/descent profiles that no random-waypoint generator can match. Trajectory data exports to multiple formats. For signal-level simulation, realtime-adsb-out (github.com/Matioupi/realtime-adsb-out) generates actual Mode S IQ samples with configurable trajectories (fixed, circular, waypoint-based) that decode through dump1090 to SBS/Beast/JSON on standard ports.
The readsb decoder (github.com/wiedehopf/readsb) serves as the ideal ADS-B data hub — its --net-only mode accepts Beast/SBS/raw input from any source and outputs to all standard formats (Beast, SBS, JSON, ASTERIX, VRS) on configurable TCP ports. Combined with tar1090 for web visualization, it provides a complete aircraft tracking display. The SDR-Enthusiasts Docker Ultrafeeder (github.com/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-adsb-ultrafeeder) packages readsb + tar1090 in a single container accepting simulated feeds.
The traffic Python library (MIT, github.com/xoolive/traffic) connects to OpenSky Network for downloading real historical ADS-B trajectories over Malaysian airspace, which can be replayed with modified identifiers for maximum realism.
Ground vehicle simulation with road-network fidelity
Eclipse SUMO (EPL 2.0, eclipse.dev/sumo) is the critical tool for realistic ground vehicle movement. This microscopic traffic simulator imports real road networks from OpenStreetMap, generates vehicle routes following actual roads and obeying traffic rules, and provides a Python TraCI API for real-time control. It can simulate unlimited vehicles across any city's road network — ideal for generating police patrol routes, customs vehicle movements, and military convoy patterns around Kuala Lumpur, Johor Bahru, or border areas.
Traccar (Apache 2.0, traccar.org) provides a complete GPS fleet tracking system with 200+ protocol support, a modern React/MapLibre web frontend, and a REST API. Community-created Python simulators feed position data via the OsmAnd HTTP protocol. Traccar's demo server at demo.traccar.org shows the live tracking interface.

Tier 3: Visualization frameworks and military symbology
CesiumJS is the optimal 3D visualization engine
CesiumJS (Apache 2.0, cesium.com) is the only open-source framework providing a true 3D globe with native time-dynamic entity animation, CZML streaming, terrain rendering, and multi-domain visualization. Aircraft render at altitude, ships on the sea surface, and vehicles on terrain — all with interpolated movement between position updates. The SampledPositionProperty class handles smooth animation, and CzmlDataSource.process() applies streaming updates without clearing existing entities.
Military symbology integrates via milsymbol.js (MIT, github.com/spatialillusions/milsymbol), which renders MIL-STD-2525B/C/D/E and APP-6 symbols as Canvas or SVG in <20ms per 1,000 symbols. The pattern is: milsymbol generates Canvas images → Cesium renders them as billboards at entity positions. The Army Game Studio already uses Cesium for Unreal with DIS 6.0 protocol support for battlefield visualization, and OpenSensorHub demonstrated a CesiumJS-based military IoT COP at I/ITSEC and GEOINT conferences.
The recommended web tech stack: CesiumJS + milsymbol.js + WebSocket + React (Resium wrapper) for 3D, or MapLibre GL + milsymbol.js + deck.gl for lighter-weight 2D. Both stacks are proven in defense applications.
Notable open-source C2 display projects
Several existing projects demonstrate the architecture pattern:
ODIN C2IS (MIT, github.com/syncpoint/ODINv2) — Electron desktop app with MIL-STD-2525C/D symbology, tactical graphics, MGRS coordinates, and WebSocket integration. Developed by Austrian defense consultants and tested at NATO CWIX interoperability sessions.
ORBAT Mapper (MIT, orbat-mapper.app) — MapLibre GL + milsymbol web app for order-of-battle visualization with time-dynamic unit movement. Excellent code reference for building a web-based COP.
Esri Dynamic Situational Awareness (Apache 2.0, github.com/Esri/dynamic-situational-awareness-qt) — Professional C2 display with MIL-STD-2525C symbology, CoT format support, 3D terrain, and critically, a built-in Message Simulator for generating simulated position reports. Requires ArcGIS Maps SDK.
CloudTAK (github.com/dfpc-coe/CloudTAK) — Browser-based COP compatible with TAK Server, built on MapLibre GL with ETL for non-TAK data sources.
EMP SDK (Apache 2.0, missioncommand.github.io) — US Army Mission Command's Extensible Mapping Platform abstracting Leaflet and CesiumJS with native MIL-STD-2525 tactical graphics support.
Node-RED + web-worldmap (Apache 2.0, github.com/dceejay/RedMap) — Leaflet-based map with built-in MIL-STD-2525 symbology via milsymbol, TAK/CoT ingest, ship/plane/car icons with bearing alignment, range rings, and real-time entity updates via JSON messages. The fastest path to a working demo — achievable in hours, not days.
Commercial defense GIS worth considering
Luciad (Hexagon) is purpose-built for defense C2 with native MIL-STD-2525 and APP-6 support, designed for real-time tracking of moving targets. Used by NATO, Thales (UK RAF), and others — 70% of Luciad's business is defense. LuciadRIA delivers desktop-like performance in browsers via WebGL. Ansys STK (formerly AGI) provides physics-based entity simulation across all domains with CZML export for CesiumJS rendering — used by 700+ organizations including NASA and DoD. Both carry enterprise pricing.

RTS engines and wargaming tools as alternative foundations
Spring/Recoil engine offers real-time data export
The Spring RTS engine (GPL, springrts.com), modernized as the Recoil engine powering Beyond All Reason, supports 5,000+ entities across land, sea, and air with an extensively documented Lua API. Critically, it includes LuaSocket support — widgets can open TCP/UDP sockets to export entity positions in real time. Functions like Spring.GetUnitPosition() and Spring.GetAllUnits() provide full entity state access. Maps can be built from satellite imagery (heightmap + texture) using Spring's tile format tools. The BAR fork adds OpenGL 4 rendering with modern shaders and 4K textures. A Spring forum user demonstrated linking game units to physical RC vehicles via sockets, proving the engine works as a real-world C2 bridge.
Godot Engine (MIT, godotengine.org) is the strongest "build from scratch" option, with native WebSocket/TCP/UDP networking, Python-like GDScript, and Vulkan rendering. Multiple open-source RTS templates exist (godot-open-rts). A forum user specifically discussed USGS/NGA-style maps with UTM/MGRS coordinates, demonstrating military applicability. The MIT license eliminates copyleft concerns.
Boomslang: an open-source C2 simulator on GitHub
Boomslang C2 Simulator (BSD-3, github.com/kabartsjc/boomslang-c2-sim) is a Java-based publish-subscribe architecture covering air, land, navy, space, and cyber domains with four engines: Physical (movement), C2 Simulator (mission execution), Communication (comms effects), and Weather. JSON configuration files define entities and exercises. It models communication disruption, weather effects, and entity health/cost/impact. The project is small (9 stars) and lacks a visual frontend, but its architecture is directly relevant and could be paired with a CesiumJS or Leaflet display layer.

Best practices for realistic simulation and impressive demos
Entity movement patterns that look convincing
Maritime: Use historical AIS data as route templates. Ships should follow Traffic Separation Schemes, slow near pilot boarding areas, and exhibit ±0.5–2 knot speed variation with ±2–5° heading oscillation. Agent-based modeling (ABM) is the academically validated approach — DLR's Maritime Traffic Simulation uses configurable multi-agent systems with stochastic influences to replicate real traffic patterns.
Aircraft: BlueSky's physics-based performance models are the gold standard. Follow published airways (available from ICAO AIP), model SIDs/STARs for airport approaches, and implement realistic speed/altitude profiles: airliners cruise at FL300–FL410 / 450–550 knots, fighters at 500–600+ knots with up to 50,000 ft/min climb rates, helicopters at 100–150 knots. For Malaysian airspace, use real-world fixes and airways from WMKK (KL), WMKP (Penang), WMLK (Langkawi).
Ground: Eclipse SUMO provides road-network-faithful movement from OSM data. Add patrol patterns with randomized loops and dwell times at checkpoints. Convoy spacing should be 50–100m between vehicles. Infantry moves at 3–5 km/h in bounding overwatch formations.
Making data look real: Vary update rates by entity type (fast movers every 2–5s, slow movers every 15–30s). Add noise to positions. Include behavioral realism — ships slowing near ports, aircraft descending on approach, patrol vessels altering course to investigate contacts.
UI/UX patterns from military COPs and RTS games
The most effective COP displays follow Endsley's Situation Awareness model: Level 1 (perceive entity positions clearly via MIL-STD-2525D symbology on de-saturated map backgrounds), Level 2 (comprehend through color-coded affiliations, track history trails, and speed leader arrows), Level 3 (project via predicted position lines and threat corridors). Essential UI elements include: fading track trails (5–10 historic positions), entity metadata on hover (callsign, speed, heading, agency, last update), timeline playback controls (1x/2x/5x/10x/60x), and agency filter toggles.
From RTS games, borrow: minimaps with clickable viewport navigation, semantic zoom (strategic overview → tactical detail), fog of war adapted as sensor range visualization (coverage circles showing radar/sonar range with visible gaps), follow mode (lock camera to entity), and group management hierarchies adapted as task organization trees. The key aesthetic insight: dark/de-saturated map backgrounds make colored symbology pop — the US Navy's Aegis implementation specifically validates this approach.
Architecture for modular, demo-ready systems
The proven pattern is a three-tier architecture: simulation engine → message bus → display frontend(s). The simulation backend maintains entity state and calculates movement. A lightweight pub/sub layer (Redis, MQTT, or ZeroMQ for demos; DIS or HLA for military interop) distributes entity updates. The display layer consumes updates via WebSocket (preferred over SSE for bidirectional interaction) using either CZML streaming to CesiumJS or GeoJSON updates to MapLibre/Leaflet.
For entity data format, TacticalJSON (GeoJSON extended with MIL-STD-2525 SIDCs) offers the best web performance — JSON parsing is significantly faster than XML (CoT) in browsers while preserving military metadata. The Cursor on Target protocol remains important for TAK ecosystem compatibility.

Recommended implementation paths ranked by scenario
Path A: Fastest demo (hours to days)
Node-RED + node-red-contrib-web-worldmap with inject nodes generating simulated entity positions using MIL-STD-2525 SIDC codes. Built-in milsymbol rendering, ship/plane/car icons, TAK ingest, and range rings. Zero coding beyond Node-RED flow configuration.
Path B: Best open-source production system (1–3 weeks)
FreeTAKServer + PyTAK simulator scripts + WebTAK/ATAK clients + CesiumJS custom dashboard. PyTAK scripts generate multi-agency entities in CoT format; FreeTAKServer distributes to TAK clients for authentic military display; AISCOT/ADSBCOT add maritime and aviation layers; a custom CesiumJS + milsymbol web app provides the command-center "big screen" COP. Eclipse SUMO generates road-faithful vehicle tracks. Cost: $0 in software.
Path C: Best commercial demo (days to weeks)
VR-Forces (simulation engine) feeding SitaWare (C2 display) via DIS/HLA. VR-Forces generates all multi-domain entities with autonomous behaviors. SitaWare provides the NATO-grade Joint COP that senior officials expect. MAK's existing Malaysian partnership (Kemalak Group in KL) accelerates deployment. This is the highest-fidelity option and the most likely to impress at DSA 2026.
Path D: Best value with maximum API flexibility (1–2 weeks)
Command: Modern Operations ($80 on Steam) for scenario validation, then upgrade to Command PE Standard Edition for the Lua TCP/IP socket API. Build a custom CesiumJS + milsymbol web dashboard consuming real-time entity data from the Lua API. Command PE's comprehensive military database eliminates the need to model entity performance from scratch. Proven at the Pentagon and with major defense contractors.
Path E: Maximum visual impact for trade show
VBS4/OneArc (3D visualization) + MASA SWORD (constructive AI backend). SWORD runs autonomous multi-agency scenarios with AI-driven behaviors reducing operator requirements by 70%. VBS4 provides stunning 3D visuals from orbital views to ground-level detail with whole-earth terrain. This combination is used by the French Army and Nigerian Army and now unified under BAE Systems' OneArc brand.
Conclusion
The simulation platform landscape for C2 demonstration divides cleanly into two viable strategies. The open-source path — FreeTAKServer + PyTAK + CesiumJS + milsymbol + BlueSky + pyais + Eclipse SUMO — can deliver a fully functional multi-domain COP at zero software cost, with the TAK ecosystem providing battle-tested military-grade visualization and the CoT protocol ensuring compatibility with real defense systems. The commercial path — VR-Forces or Command PE feeding SitaWare or a custom CesiumJS display — delivers higher fidelity and lower development risk, with VR-Forces' existing Malaysian presence (Kemalak Group in KL) providing a direct procurement channel.
Three non-obvious findings emerged from this research. First, Node-RED's web-worldmap plugin has built-in MIL-STD-2525 symbology rendering — a fact that makes it the single fastest path to a working prototype, achievable in hours rather than weeks. Second, the Boomslang C2 Simulator on GitHub is a purpose-built open-source C2 simulation architecture covering all five domains, but it lacks a visual frontend and would need CesiumJS or Leaflet integration. Third, DSA 2026 (April 20–23, MITEC KL) now includes a "Future Forces" segment focused specifically on AI, data integration, net-centric warfare, and multi-domain operations — making a multi-agency C2 demo particularly timely for that venue.
The strongest single recommendation for a rapid, impressive, deployable system is Path B with CesiumJS enhancement: FreeTAKServer as the message backbone, PyTAK scripts simulating all five agency types, CesiumJS + milsymbol for a 3D globe COP on the command center display, and ATAK tablets for field-operator perspective — all running against Malaysian geography with Strait of Malacca shipping lanes, RMAF airways, and real road networks from OpenStreetMap.
