# Combined Demo Scenario — ESSZONE Multi-Domain Operations
#
# CORRECTED VERSION — see SCENARIO_AUDIT.md for detailed changelog
#
# Changes from original:
#   - RMAF-MPA-101: RMAF_TRANSPORT → RMAF_MPA (was showing as cargo plane, not patrol aircraft)
#   - RMN-FIC-*: MIL_NAVAL → MIL_NAVAL_FIC (G2000s are patrol craft, not corvettes)
#   - RMP-MP-*: RMP_PATROL_CAR → RMP_MARINE_PATROL (these are boats, not cars)
#   - Responder starting positions tightened to make intercept physics plausible
#   - Missing deploy destinations added
#   - HOSTILE-001/002 affiliation reclassification event added
#
# Demo audience: Senior Malaysian defense/security officials (April 2026)
#
# Structure:
#   Part 1 (0:00 - 0:55): IUU Fishing Fleet Intercept
#   Part 2 (1:00 - 2:15): Kidnapping-for-Ransom Response
#
# Recommended demo speed: Start at 5x, slow to 2x during action sequences,
# 1x during boarding/resolution for dramatic effect.
#
# Total runtime at 1x: ~135 minutes
# Total runtime at 5x: ~27 minutes (recommended for briefing)
# Total runtime at 10x: ~14 minutes (quick overview)

scenario:
  name: "ESSZONE Multi-Domain Operations — Combined Demo"
  description: |
    Combined demonstration of Edge C2 capabilities in the Eastern Sabah
    Security Zone (ESSZONE), showcasing multi-agency coordination under
    ESSCOM across two operational scenarios:

    Part 1: An illegal fishing fleet from Vietnam is detected poaching in
    Malaysian EEZ waters off Sandakan. ESSCOM coordinates MMEA, RMN, RMAF,
    RMP Marine Police, and Customs & Immigration for intercept, boarding,
    and crew processing.

    Part 2: Armed militants cross from the Sulu Archipelago and attack a
    fishing village near Semporna, kidnapping hostages. ESSCOM activates
    Operation Pasir enhanced protocols with full multi-agency pursuit across
    the Sulu Sea.

    Demonstrates: maritime surveillance, AIS anomaly detection, multi-agency
    joint operations, cross-border incursion response, Operation Pasir sea
    curfew, aerial ISR, tactical team insertion, naval fast intercept, border
    lockdown, and Trilateral cooperation notification.
