# Scenario 2: Kidnapping-for-Ransom Response — Semporna Islands
#
# An armed group from the southern Philippines crosses the Sulu Sea in
# speedboats and attacks a fishing village on an island near Semporna,
# kidnapping Malaysian and foreign nationals. ESSCOM activates a full
# multi-agency response: RMP Marine Police and GOF as primary law enforcement,
# Malaysian Armed Forces for area denial and pursuit, MMEA for maritime
# interdiction, RMAF for aerial surveillance and troop transport, and
# Customs/Immigration for border lockdown.
#
# This scenario demonstrates:
# - Cross-border maritime incursion detection
# - ESSCOM joint command activation
# - Operation Pasir sea curfew enforcement
# - Multi-agency pursuit and interdiction
# - RMP GOF (General Operations Force) tactical response
# - Navy fast interceptor craft pursuit
# - RMAF helicopter insertion and aerial ISR
# - Coastal radar network tracking
# - Border lockdown by Customs/Immigration
# - Trilateral coordination (reference to Philippines/Indonesia)
#
# Geographic focus: Semporna islands, 18km from Philippine waters

scenario:
  name: "Kidnapping-for-Ransom Response — Semporna"
  description: |
    At 0430 hours, two speedboats carrying armed militants cross from the
    Sulu Archipelago into Malaysian waters near Semporna. The group lands
    on Pulau Bum Bum and seizes hostages from a fishing village. A fisherman
    escapes and alerts authorities. ESSCOM activates full response under
    Operation Pasir protocols — sea curfew enforced, all ESSZONE agencies
    mobilized. The militants attempt to flee back to Philippine waters with
    hostages. Multi-agency pursuit across the Sulu Sea.
